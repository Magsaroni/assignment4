<h1> W4 Assignment for CSC104, Magaly Valdez </h1>   

<h2> Across the Spiderverse </h2>
<p> Spider-Man: Across the Spiderverse is a sequal to the movie to "Spider-Man: Into The Spiderverse" It takes place a year after the events of ITSV (Into The Spiderverse) Here, I will be explaining a little bit about the movie. </p>
   <p> Our movie begins wth Gwen Stacy, AKA Spider-Woman. She's basically telling a bit about the movie all in th ebeginning, and some scenes throughout the whole movie are incorparated with her dialouge. 
    She talks about how she hurt Miles, Spider-Man from Earth 1610. This statement alone is sort of like a spoiler for the movie too, as later on she ends up unintentionally hurting Miles.
    People have said online that this movie sort of takes place in Gwen's perspective (at times, since there is Miles alone doing his own thing before Gwen visits him.)

   <p> Miles Morales is a 15 year old boy, he is the Spider-Man of his Earth, 1610. His resides in Brooklyn, living with his roommate Ganke in Visions High. His parents also live in Brookyln, his mother being Rio Morales and his father being Jeff Morales. He is just about to become captain, since he is a police officer. There is a specific canon event that happens to a captain close to Spider-Man, however.
    As stated by Miguel O'Hara (the main man running the Spider Society that Gwen is in), the canon event is when the captain (or anythign like that) that is close to Spider-Man dies trying to save someone from Spider-Man's nemises.
   </p>
   <h3> But what is a "Canon Event"?</h3>
   <p> As described by Miguel O'Hara, a canon event is when an event happens to Spider-Man that *HAS* to happen. For example, getting bit by the radioactive spider is a canon event, it must happen. Uncle Ben dying (or any close relative, since Miles' Uncle Ben was his Uncle, Uncle Aaron) is also a canon event, and a captain close to Spider-Man dying is also a canon event. Some are terrible, some are good, but some are really terrible.</p>

   <h4> Who is Miguel O'Hara and what is this whole "Spider Society" thing?</h4>
   <p> Miguel O'Hara is Nueva York's Spider-Man from Earth 2099. The New York is set in a futuristic, high tec place with flying cars and just an overall highly advanced look.
    He originally was that Earth's only Spider-Man, but he formed an elite force with all the strongest Spider people. From dinosaurs and cars as Spider people, to western like Spider people and many more, they all reside in this huge place called the "Spider Society."
    They live their normal lives, but to prevent themselves from glitching in that universe, or any universe for that matter, they wear these watches. Not only is it useful to not glitch out, they use these watches to warp to other dimesnsions, or Earths, and complete missions there.
    "What are their missions" you may ask? They wrangle up all the anomalies. The anomalies are enemies that are in universes they aren't supposed to be in. For example, at the start of the movie, a enemy called "The Vulture" got into Gwen Stacy's universe, but the only problem was that that Vulture wasn't from HER universe. The guy came from some sort Leonardo DaVinci world, so that enemy being there when he wasn't supposed to be there was an anomaly.
    They send back anomalies back to their respective universes, by using the "Go Home" machine. It is a very strange and creepy looking thing, however. One of the characters that are aquantited with Gwen and Miles is Hobie Brown, and he states (as there is a enemy being sent into the Go Home machine) that it totally isn't creepy and is totally humaine (that last part being sarcasm). It is a freaky looking thing.

   </h5>
   <p> As of now, the movie is left at a cliff hanger. Miles went into the Go Home machine but he didn't get sent to his Earth. The spider that bit him wasn't supposed to be there and wasn't even supposed to bite him. It was supposed to bite the Miles Morales from Earth 42, so because the machine scans your DNA in order to send you back home, it read the DNA from Earth 42. The spider that was suppsoed to belong from there. He got sent into Earth 42, and ultimately got to see his uncle again. The only thign was, the Miles from that Earth knocked him out, tying him to Earth 42's Aaron's punching bag. It was revealed that Earth 42 Miles is the Prowler of his world, which is the bad guy. So, it got left at Miles from 1610 being stuck in front of his villianous counterpart. He needs to find a way home, his ACTUAL home. But, Miguel O'hara, Scarlet Spider, and Jessica Drew are all out to search for him since he wasn't supposed to go back home.
    Meanwhile, Gwen Stacy and a whole lot of Miles' friends are going back to search for hima nd get him to his respective home since Gwen (with ehr spdier sense) knew that he wasn't in his right universe.
   </p>
   <p> As of now, it is not fully known when the next movie (which we already know what is named since at the end of the credits it was said what the title would be for the next move, Spdier-Man: Beyond the Spiderverse) will release. Because of the strike going on, that is why it isn't known. But until then, we can speculate on what will happen and enjoy the soundtracks that came out of it, along with the style of the movie and many more. We can also continue supporting the writers, artists, and more that make this movie possible. </p>
